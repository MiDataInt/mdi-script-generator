The first time you run a new script, you will get a message that 
warns you that its contents are unknown to Windows, e.g.:

<div style="margin: 1em 2em; padding-left: 1em; border-left: 2px solid grey;">
<strong>Windows protected your PC</strong></br>
Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting. 
Running this app might put your PC at risk.</br>
<u>More info</u></br>
</div>

Please click **<code>More info</code>** and then **<code>Run anyway</code>** 
to give Windows permission to run the script.

#### Installing SSH

Scripts that run the MDI on remote servers require
that SSH be available on your computer. Modern Windows 10
installations should already have SSH installed and ready.
If not, see the following:
