### R Version

---
OBSOLETE: support for mdi-singularity-base has been disabled
---

As a recommended alternative to running R and the MDI server
directly on your host computer, you can also run the MDI
within a Singularity container.

When using containers, please provide the major.minor
version of R you wish to use, which is the same value
used to tag different 
[mdi-singularity-base](https://github.com/MiDataInt/mdi-singularity-base)
containers. 

**Examples**

- v4.1
- 4.1

Please see the 
[list of available versions](https://github.com/MiDataInt/mdi-singularity-base/pkgs/container/mdi-singularity-base).

R Version can be left blank if you will not use Singularity containers
to run the apps server.
