### MDI Run Modes

The MDI can run in different ways on different computer setups.
The modes differ in which computer is used to run the Stage 1

Critically, each "run mode" results in essentially the same 
tools interface. Your choice of run mode should thus be dependent
on usage considerations discussed below.
