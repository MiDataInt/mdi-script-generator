### Memory per CPU

Please specify the amount of memory you would like assigned
to _each_ CPU that will run your server. 

The value should be provided with a single-letter lower-case
suffix to indicate the memory unit, e.g., 'm' or 'g' for 
MB or GB, respectively.

**Example**
- CPUs per Task = 2
- Memory per CPU = 4g
- 2 * 4 = 8 GB of requested memory
