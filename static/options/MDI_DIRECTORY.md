### MDI Directory

Please specify the full path where you would like to 
install the MDI (or where it has already been installed).

If the provided **MDI Directory** ends with 'mdi' it will be used as is, otherwise 
software will be installed into a sub-folder named 'mdi'.

The installer will create the mdi sub-folder as needed, but 
the parent folder must already exist and will not be created for you to prevent unintended actions.

#### Examples: Windows
- C:\path\to\mdi  
- C:\path\to (equivalent to above)

#### Examples: Mac or Linux
- /path/to/mdi  
- /path/to (equivalent to above)

Hint: you can usually copy these file paths from your computer rather than typing them out manually!
