### Installation Directory (a.k.a. MDI Directory)

Please provide the full path where you would like to/have already
installed the MDI.

If **Installation Directory** ends with 'mdi' it will be used as is, otherwise 
code will be installed into a subfolder named 'mdi'.
The installer will create the 'mdi' subfolder as needed, but 
the parent folder must already exist to prevent unintended actions.

The following examples are all equivalent.

**Windows**
- C:\path\to\mdi  
- C:\path\to

**Mac or Linux**
- /path/to/mdi  
- /path/to

Hint: you can usually copy file paths from your computer rather than typing them out manually.
