### Install Packages

If checked, the MDI installer will install R packages used
by Stage 2 apps. 

You may wish to uncheck this option if you
will only use Stage 1 pipelines, since R package installation 
can take a long time the first time you do it.

This option is equivalent to the the 'installPackages' argument
to <code>mdi::install()</code>.
