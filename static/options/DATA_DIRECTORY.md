### Data Directory

When used with default options, all of the code and data used by the MDI resides under the MDI Directory, e.g., /path/to/mdi.

However, sometimes a laboratory or research group will wish
to share the data files produced by Stage 2 app between multiple users. You can easily implement such shared data by providing a value for **Data Directory**, which
is simply a full path to any valid shared directory.

When a Data Directory is provided, it replaces the Stage 2 apps **data** folder.

Please consult with the administrator in your research team to determine what path to enter here.

If you are not using a shared data folder, simply leave this option blank.

#### Example
- /path/to/hosted/mdi
