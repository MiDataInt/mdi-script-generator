### Identity Key File

Please provide the full path to an SSH key file that can be
used to log into the computer at Server Domain. Please consult
your server administrator for how to set up SSH key login.

**Identity Key File** is recommended if supported by your
server, but optional. If missing, you will log
in to your server by a password prompt and possibly also
two-factor authentication.
