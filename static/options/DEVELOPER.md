### Developer Mode

If checked, the batch script will launch the MDI web server
in **Developer Mode**, which provides verbose logging and access
to code development tools in the web interface. 

End users should leave this option unchecked.

This option is equivalent to the 'developer' argument
of <code>mdi::run()</code>.
