### Installation CPU

The number of CPUs that will be used to compile R packages
during installation of the Stage 2 apps server.

The apps server requires many R packages that can take a long
time to install the first time on a Linux server. The more
CPUs you can provide, the faster the installation will go.

We recommend using at least 4 CPUs if possible, preferably 8.
