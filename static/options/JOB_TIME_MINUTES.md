### Job Time Minutes

Please indicate the integer time in minutes you would like your web server to run.

**Job Time Minutes** is the _maximum_ time that the server will run - 
you can always terminate the server when you are done using it
to avoid accumulating charges.

Job Time Minutes prevents you from unwittingly launching a server
that runs perpetually because you forgot to terminate it or lost
your network connection.
