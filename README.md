# mdi-script-generator
shinyapps.io script generation server for the Michigan Data Interface

This repository carries the code that runs the MDI public script generator
app hosted at url https://XXX.shinyapps.io.

This repository is only intended for use by MDI project administrators.
The code is shared publicly for transparency about how batch scripts
are generated.

If desired, however, anyone could run the script generator app
locally, or on another shinyapps.io instance. Instructions for 
logging in and deploying Shiny apps to shinyapps.io can be found here:
